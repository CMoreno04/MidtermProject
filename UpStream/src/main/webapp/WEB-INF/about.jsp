  <blockquote class="lead">
  The main goal of Up-Stream is to facilitate subscriber efficiency for the multitude of streaming services now available. According to Forbes.com, "the average American subscriber watches 3.4 services. For each one, they pay an average $8.53 per month”. With Up-Stream, our users can add what streaming services they are using, what they are spending monthly on said services, and track what content they’re actually watching on their services. If a user is only viewing two or three things on a service and paying $6.99 a month, they can see that and decided if it’s worth the value. They can also browse other services and their content to see if they would like to get a subscription as well or instead of. Our users will be able to make sure that they have the best value for their viewing needs. </blockquote>
